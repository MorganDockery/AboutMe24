## My Philosophy

*As long as you aren't shooting yourself in the foot, shoot for the stars.*

"Maybe I was born to play ball. Maybe **I truly was."** *- Willie Mays*

"Me, as a person, I grow. I'm like a chameleon. You know? That is a gift and a curse for me. But more so a gift, because **it never puts me in a box."** *- Kendrick Lamar*
